This Repository contains the code used for running the experiments for the paper "Differential Privacy in Federated Learning: An analysis of Output
Perturbation and differentially-private SGD"

Files

    'algo.py': This script implements a logistic regression algorithm, which can be trained with DP-SGD. 
    
    'attack.py' : contains methods allowing to perform memberhsip inference attack
    
    

Usage
